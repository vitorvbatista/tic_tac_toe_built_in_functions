# tic_tac_toe_built_in_functions

READ ME:

This project intends to be a tic tac toe game. 
The main objective is to take advantages of built in functions only, practice the fundamentals of python programming and avoid imported packages. 
You'll see that all functions we're built in one class and they'll call each other during this game.
